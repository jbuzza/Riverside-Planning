# Riverside-Planning

This project was primarily a learning exercise but also served to analyse public comments submitted against the Twickenham Riverside planning application made by the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on 27-Nov-2017.

The project was completed using R Markdown and resulted in maps showing the origin of different types of comments submitted by the public.
